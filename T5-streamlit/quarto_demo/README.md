# Quarto demo

Quarto is a tool for converting your notebooks into reports and presentations.
But it can do even more!

You should check out their [official website](https://quarto.org/) to download the tool, install and play with numerous tutorials.

To crate the html report you just run `quarto render report.ipynb`.
Exporting to pdf requires specifying the output format as so: `quarto render report.ipynb -t pdf`.

If you want to work with the report in an interactive way I recommend checking out `quarto preview report.ipynb`.
